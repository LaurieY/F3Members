<p>Dear *|forename|*</p>

<p>Thank you for subscribing once again to U3A Marbella and Inland. For your records your membership number is *|membnum|* and your next membership payment is due in September *|renewal|*.</br>
Please make a note of your number since it will increasingly be needed to register for activities and events.</p><p>

<p>If you have not already done so please visit our website, <a href="http://www.u3a.es/">www.u3a.es</a>, and carefully view our current programme to see if there are other activities which might take your eye. As a member you are entitled to apply to join in any activity subject to the availability of a place. The first port of call should always be to contact the leader of anything in which you may be interested to find out more details. If a place is available the leader will normally invite you to attend without any obligation on your part. The only limit on your participation in activities is that imposed by your time.</p>

<p>We are supported by a number of businesses that kindly make premises available to us and in return we are morally obligated to support them with due consideration and by the purchase of coffee or other beverages. Moreover since our association is completely voluntary we do, in fact, entirely rely on the goodwill of administrators and group leaders. It is important then that members also give particular regard to these organisers to help make participation for everyone as enjoyable as possible. We all belong to little teams within a big team.</p>

<p>You may have a strong interest in something that is not currently represented. If you feel there is a contribution you can make in terms of organising a group or indeed helping with administration of one this would be most appreciated. Often groups are just co-operatives of like minded people. Every assistance will be given.</p>

<p>In the meantime please continue join in con mucho gusto.</p>

<p>You may feel free to contact me on any matter.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Allan </p>
